<p><strong><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em></strong> The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pack Tactics.</em></strong> The werewolf has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the werewolf's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> The werewolf regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the werewolf takes necrotic damage or bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a silvered weapon, this trait doesn't function at the start of the werewolf's next turn. The werewolf dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The werewolf makes two attacks: two with its spear (humanoid form) or one with its bite and one with its claws (wolf or hybrid form).</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the werewolf can grapple the target (escape DC 11). Additionally, if the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spear (Humanoid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Shapechange.</em></strong> The werewolf polymorphs into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying melds into the new form. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Unarmored Defense.</em></strong> While the werewolf is wearing no armor, its AC includes its Constitution modifier.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The werewolf makes two attacks with its spear (humanoid form) or one attack with its bite and two attacks with its claws (wolf or hybrid form). It can replace one claws attack with a lob.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Additionally, if the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be grappled.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spear (Humanoid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lob.</em></strong> The werewolf forces a creature it's grappling to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is thrown 10 feet and falls prone. If the target can’t move the full distance, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 5 feet not moved.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Shapechange.</em></strong> The werewolf polymorphs into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying melds into the new form. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Crushing Grip.</em></strong> The werewolf forces a creature it's grappling to succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a failure, and half as much damage on a success. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also dazed until the end of its next turn. (The creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can't take a bonus action or a reaction.)

<p><strong><em>Life Drain.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). The wight commander and all non-hostile undead within 10 feet of it regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. In addition, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum be reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. </p>
<p><strong><em>Longsword.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage, or 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage if used with two hands.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Undead Fortitude.</em></strong> If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Unusual Nature.</em></strong> The zombie doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Viral Aura.</em></strong> Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the plague spreader must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned and can’t regain hit points until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this plague spreader’s Viral Aura for 24 hours.</p>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The plague spreader makes two Slam attacks.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Slam.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Virulent Miasma (1/Day).</em></strong> The plague spreader releases toxic gas in a 30‑foot‑radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies and rises as a zombie (see its stat block in the Monster Manual) 1 minute later. The zombie acts immediately after the plague spreader in the initiative count.</p>
