A player seeking **knowledge** begins the campaign with the *amber shard*, a small chunk of amber resin mounted on a chain-link cord. The shard is inset with complex, three-dimensional arcane runes. When viewed under the *detect magic* spell, it exudes a strong aura of abjuration magic.

The player who possesses the *amber shard* should have strong, vivid reasons to want to unlock its secrets and the magic that it possesses.

![Angel's Feather](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Angel's%20Feather.png)
A player seeking **redemption** begins the campaign with the *angel's feather*, a large, snow-white feather. When viewed beneath the light of the morning sun, the feather's barbs glimmer like gold.

The player who possesses the *angel's feather* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will one day lead them to redemption for the sins that they have committed.
## Family—The Wanderer's Scarf
![Wanderer's Scarf.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Wanderer's%20Scarf.png)
A player seeking **family** begins the campaign with the *wanderer's scarf*, a multicolored scarf woven with complex patterns. The fabric is soft and warm, and is long enough to be worn around the neck or over one's head. When bright sunlight, moonlight, or starlight is allowed to pass through it, the patterns seem to shimmer and twist in eerie and beautiful ways.

The player who possesses the *wanderer's scarf* should have received the scarf from a beloved family member, and should have strong, vivid reasons to long for a sense of family and belonging.
## Inheritance—The Dragon's Scale
![Dragon's Scale.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Dragon's%20Scale.png)
A player seeking **inheritance** begins the campaign with the *dragon's scale*, a large silver scale that always feels cold to the touch. A Good-aligned creature that touches the scale feels a fleeting sense of safety, protection, and comfort.

The player who possesses the *dragon's scale* should have received the scale from a family member, and should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the scale will one day unlock the secrets of their heritage.
## Wealth—The Electrum Coin
![Electrum Coin.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Electrum%20Coin.png)
A player seeking **wealth** begins the campaign with an old, chipped *electrum coin* stamped with the profiled visage of a proud, yet cold-looking nobleman. When seen in a certain light, the nobleman's expression seems to change from a firm, aristocratic sneer to a feral, monstrous snarl.

The player who possesses the *electrum coin* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the coin first came from a wondrous vault of treasure—a conqueror's hoard—and that, one day, it will lead them to claim riches beyond imagining.

## Healing—The Wolf's Tooth
![Wolf's Tooth.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Wolf's%20Tooth.png)
A player seeking **healing** begins the campaign with a *wolf's tooth* coated with clear resin and mounted on a leather cord. The tooth seems to lengthen and sharpen on nights of the full moon, and calms its wearer's dreams when worn at night.

The player who possesses the *wolf's tooth* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the tooth is the key to curing a particular wound, malady, or curse that ails them.

## Duty—The Raven's Feather
![Raven's Feather.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Raven's%20Feather.png)
A player seeking **duty** begins the campaign with a *raven's feather*, a small, black feather with soft, downy barbs. When held aloft before a storm, the feather seems to gently tremble, exuding the scent of cold rain and damp earth.

The player who possesses the *raven's feather* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will always guide them to those who need aid, protection, and comfort.

## Power—The Crumpled Page
![Crumpled Page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Crumpled%20Page.png)
A player seeking **power** begins the campaign with the *crumpled page*, an old, yellowed page that was torn from its book long ago. The page is written in strange and cryptic arcane runes; those few runes that can be decoded speak of a path that leads to immortality and untold power.

The player who possesses the *crumpled page* should have strong, vivid reasons to want to find and claim the power that the page promises.

## Ambition—The Tattered Banner
![Tattered Banner.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Tattered%20Banner.png)
A player seeking **ambition** begins the campaign with the *tattered banner*, an old, ragged red banner bearing the heraldry of a raven in front of a shield. The raven's wings are spread wide, and the shield has the image of a castle's keep engraved into its top. Sometimes, when a Lawful-aligned creature holds the banner, a crimson light seems to glimmer from the peak of the castle's keep, and the sound of soldiers marching can be distantly heard.

The player who possesses the *tattered banner* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the banner was once the sigil of a mighty conqueror—and that, by following in that conqueror's steps, they will one day achieve greatness, glory, and the right to rule.

## Faith—The Sunrise Medallion
![Sunrise Medallion.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Sunrise%20Medallion.png)
A player seeking **faith** begins the campaign with the *sunrise medallion*, a bronze disc engraved with the image of a rising sun. The disc glitters like gold when exposed to the light of the sunrise, and a Good-aligned creature that touches it feels a fleeting sense of reverence, righteousness, and peace.

The player who possesses the *sunrise medallion* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that it will strengthen or guide them in faith, and that certain signs of the divine will lead them to those in need of salvation and deliverance.

## Harmony—The Stone Crest
![Stone Crest.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Stone%20Crest.png)
A player seeking **harmony** begins the campaign with the *stone crest*, a flat, round stone engraved with the image of a three-pointed star. On the nights of the new moon, the star seems to glimmer with emerald light.

The player who possesses the *stone crest* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the symbols upon it represent a primal or divine power of harmony and nature, and that the crest can aid them in restoring the sanctity of wild places.

## Justice—The Broken Blade
![Broken Blade.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opnet/opnet.github.com/refs/heads/master/images/Broken%20Blade.png)
A player seeking **justice** begins the campaign with the *broken blade*, the shattered tip of an elven longsword. The blade is engraved with the sigil of a lion rampant, which seems to roar when the light of dusk touches it.

The player who possesses the *broken blade* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that their ancestors were refugees, driven forth from their ancestral lands and persecuted, and that the blade will one day deliver justice to the traitor who destroyed them.
